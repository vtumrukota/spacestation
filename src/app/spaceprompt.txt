# Who is in Space?
 
## Interview Question
The Open Notify API provides information about who is currently in space. Visit [http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json](http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json) to see not only how many people are currently in space but also their names and which spacecraft they’re on.
 
Create a program that pulls in this data and displays the information from this API in a tabular format.
 
## Output
```
→ go run main.go
There are 6 people in space right now:
 
Name                | Craft
--------------------|------
Oleg Kononenko      | ISS
David Saint-Jacques | ISS
Anne McClain        | ISS
Alexey Ovchinin     | ISS
Nick Hague          | ISS
Christina Koch      | ISS
```
 
## Additional Challenges
 * Ensure that the width of the header is as long as the longest value in the column.
 * Don’t repeat the name of the craft—group all people by craft.
 * Can you reliably sort the results alphabetically by last name? Be careful—some people have spaces in their name, like “Mary Sue Van Pelt.”
